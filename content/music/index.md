# Martin Kaptein - Pianist, Educator

## Biography

The pianist Martin Kaptein, who originally comes from the Netherlands and currently resides in Bolzano, Italy, has next to music also the passion for philosophy.

One of Martin's projects that unites music and philosophy is the [Scriabin Club](https://scriabinclub.com/).
The aim of Scriabin Club is to create a community where conversations about art and life take place and like-minded people are brought together.
In addition, the creation of a music school and learning environment of the highest quality for piano lessons and general cultural education is central.

Martin comes from a background of the Russian Piano School, which is well known for its approach to musical sensitivity.
He studied with famous teachers as Michail Markov (RU), Elena Golovinskaya (RU), Frank van de Laar (NL), Vitaly Samoshko (UA) and Alessandra Brustia (IT).

In November 2022 Martin collaborated with the Scriabin Society of America in organization of a festival commemorating Scriabin's 150th anniversary.
Martin won the first prize in the famous "St. Cecilia International Piano competition" in Porto, Portugal in 2015, for which he was re-invited for solo-recitals in the consecutive years.
In 2019 together with his trio, Martin won the chamber music competition of the ArtEZ conservatory in Zwolle.

Martin himself is also a piano and music theory teacher, and sees himself as an educator in a wider sense of this word.
He has also interest in a wide range of cultures and speaks many languages.

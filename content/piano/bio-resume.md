# Martin Kaptein

## Biography

The Dutch pianist Martin Kaptein approaches music as a means of exploring the deepest questions of human existence.
He was a student of Elena Golovinskaya, Michail Markov, Frank van de Laar and Vitaly Samoshko, who helped him to achieve a unique approach to sound.

As Martin finished his Bachelor and Master studies he discovered a deep connection between music and philosophy.
After winning several international competitions, most notably the *St. Cecilia Piano Competition* (Portugal, 2015), Martin began to perform internationally. 
Martin often introduces his pieces with a brief explanation of their philosophical ideas, making them not only technical exercises but emotional and intellectual journeys.

Today, Martin continues to perform and explore the connections between music and philosophy:
In the music of the composer Alexander Scriabin he found a unique match, and often makes Scriabin's music the centerpiece of his performances.
One of Martin's projects that unites music and philosophy is the [Scriabin Club](https://scriabinclub.com/), a place where conversations about art and life happen.
In November 2022 Martin collaborated with the Scriabin Society of America in organization of a festival commemorating Scriabin's 150th anniversary.

Next to performing, Martin is also a music teacher and often finds himself giving lectures and presentations.
He has also interest in a [wide range of cultures and speaks many different languages](https://martinkaptein.com/books/).
As if that was not enough Martin also is highly interested in [Science and Technology](https://martinkaptein.com/tech/), and in his free time enjoys working on IT projects.

Martin is currently based in Bolzano, Italy.

## Professional Piano and Music lessons in the region of Bolzano and Merano

The ability to play piano is a very important and useful skill.
I offer Piano Lessons at home in the region of Bolzano, Merano, Bressanone and Trento (Italy).

The Piano Lessons are meant for students for all ages and levels.
I am highly experienced in teaching children, conservatory students and people who want to learn piano just for themselves.
For the Piano Lessons I visit you at home.

Next to Piano Lesson I also teach music theory.
This includes but is not limited to:

- Basic Music Theory to prepare for Exams.
- History of Music.
- Solfeggio, Ear training and Singing.

Currently I am teaching in the following languages:

- English
- German
- Dutch
- Russian

There is a possibility to have lessons in Italian as well, but this is a language I am currently learning.

### Teaching philosophy

My teaching philosophy is that the **Music always comes first**.
That is why it is very important to develop and individual approach and personal relation to music.

At the same time I maintain a high quality of professionalism, that can deliver results soon.

## About me

My name is Martin Kaptein, I am a professional pianist.
I perform a lot of concerts and do other projects as well.
See [here for my musical CV](/music/).

I am in possession of a Master Diploma in performing music, which gives me a diverse skill set.

[See this page for examples of my own playing](/media/).

Originally I come from the Netherlands but decided to settle now in the region of Bolzano and Merano.

## Practical

For every hour of lesson I ask EUR 50,00.
If there is considerable travel time involved I will also ask for an additional travel fee.

Usually the fee is payed after every lesson, but arrangements can be made for a set of lessons (10 Lessons) or a monthly fee.
In that case there are opportunities for discounts.

It is also possible to teach multiple students at the same time.
Also in this case I am open to arrange something with you.

## Recording Session at Emile van Leenen in Leiden

Thanks to the initiative of [the Emile van Leenen piano shop in Leiden](https://emilevanleenenpianos.nl/), on Saturday 10th of April 2021 I was able to make recordings on a beautiful Kawai Shigeru SK7.

I look very much forward to further collaborations.
Recordings shall be shared in the near future on this page as well.

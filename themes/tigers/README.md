## Installation

In the folder of your Hugo site, run:

`git clone https://github.com/martinkaptein/tigers.git themes/tigers`

In your `config.toml` file set `theme = "tigers"`.

### Hugo version

Tested with Hugo v0.70.0 and the latest v0.79.0. 

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to look at the `exampleSite` folder in the theme directory.
It already contains a multilingual website and blog, so you can easily adapt it to your project needs.

Just copy all the contents of `exampleSite` over to the folder of your Hugo site in your favourite GUI file explorer or using the command line:

`cp -r themes/tigers/exampleSite/ .`

Then change the files to your liking.

### Configuration

All configuration parameters, which are supported by this theme can be found in `/exampleSite/config.toml`.
[Here](https://github.com/martinkaptein/tigers/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) is a direct link to it.

#### Icons

You can easily add icons to your project, by overwriting the icons provided in `exampleSite`.
The icons can be gotten [from the Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
Just overwrite/place the icons in the `static` folder and the Tigers theme should pick them up automatically.
